ListingCreationDate,"Listing creation date shows the overall trend of loan issuance, and the abnormal halt happending on early 2009, when the sub-loan crisis occurred. The default rate pre-2009 is in general higher than those after 2009, which could be related to tighter regulation and loan scrutiny."
CreditScoreAvg,"Credit score is a strong indicator of a borrower's overall financial capability and responsibility. Lower credit scorers showed significant higher rate of default. Also, less current loans are issued to borrowers with low credit scores. "
StatedMonthlyIncome,"Most borrowers have monthly income around 4000 dollars. Prosper issued less loan to people having lower income. Even though, the default rate of lower income borrowers is significantly higher."
DebtToIncomeRatio,Debt to income ratio (DIR) is a good descriptor for borrower's capability to pay back loans. Most loans are issued to borrowers with < 0.5 DIR. Borrower with very low DIR also showed higher default rate: may be related to lower credit score of this group. 
ProsperScore,"Prosper score is the internal rating of a borrower. Although there is still correlation with default rate, its explainary power is much weaker than credit score."
BorrowerAPR,"The APR of the loan has a positive correlation with default rate. The reason could be two-folded: high risk borrowers will charged with higher interest rate, and higher interest rate will make borrower more susceptible to default."
